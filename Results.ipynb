    "After some initial analysis, one thing became clear: the number of tutoring hours a student received is one of the worst predictors of what their improvement will be. Looking at this aspect of the Language! curriculum numbers provides a nice example of that. Below, the number of hours a student received are plotted against their improvement in the Word Attack section. \n",

    "While there may appear to be a slight positive relationship, the Pearsonr coefficient (a measure of the correlation between two features) indicates that there is virtually no relationship between these two things in the given data. Put another way, knowing how many hours of instruction a student received explains very little about how much growth they are likely to have. This aspect of the data holds true across all three curricula. Visualizations of this can be found [here](https://github.com/cl65610/FLOC_analysis/tree/master/Visualization). \n",
